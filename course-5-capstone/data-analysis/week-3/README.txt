For the data analysis task, I'll be observing NASA's 'Metorite Landings' dataset 
provided by 'http://data.nasa.gov/'.

I chose to observe this data because I have always had a personal intrest in science,
and in this particular case space. I find interesting the idea that there's so much to 
explore and that I won't be able to observe everything that the universe provides. 
This concept has drawn my interest for many years as I draw myself to the fascination 
of what is and isn't possible in my lifetime.
